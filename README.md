# MICROCONTROLLER-BASED DRIVING BEHAVIOUR MONITORING DEVICE 

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to classify driving behavior into three categories: slow, normal, and risky. It uses data from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and speed sensors to make real-time predictions about driving patterns.
